### What we will build

At the end of this tutorial you will build a simple serverless function in Python running on Digital Ocean Serveless Functions.
The function will be able to calculate distance of a path between points on the Earth given their latitude and longitude. We will also call the function using `cURL` to test it.

### Prerequisites

- Basic [Python](https://www.python.org/) knowledge
- [Digital Ocean account](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
- [Digital Ocean CLI](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/)

### Checking if everything is installed

Let's check if we are ready to use all the tools we need for this tutorial.

- `doctl`
```bash
doctl version
# Example output: `doctl version 1.111.0-release`
```
- `doctl serverless`
```bash
doctl serverless status
```
If you have problems with `doctl serverless`, please follow the steps provided by the CLI. You may need to install the serverless plugin and create a namespace for the serverless functions.


### Setting up the project (locally)

Let's create our project.

```bash
doctl serverless init --language python world-map-path-python
```

Go to the folder with the project and open it in your favorite editor.
First thing will be creating editing `project.yaml` file.
You can pretty much cut everything out and leave only the `packages`, `name`, `functions` and `runtime` fields.
Finally the file should look like this:

```yaml
packages:
  - name: world-map-path
    functions:
      - name: distance
        runtime: python:default
```

The main `name` fields correspond to the names of directories that we will create right now.
The folder structure should look like this (create an empty `__main__.py` file in the `distance` directory):

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ packages
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ world-map-path
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ distance
â”‚Â Â          â””â”€â”€ __main__.py
â””â”€â”€ project.yml
```

Now the fun part begins, which is writing the code for the function.
For the calculations of the distance between two points on the Earth we will use the `geopy` library.
Here is a quick overview of the code that we will be using:
1. We will import the `geodesic` function from the `geopy.distance` module. This will allow us to easily calculate the distance between two points on the map.
2. There will be only one function - `main` which will take the `args` dictionary as an argument.
The `args` dictionary will contain the `points` list with the latitude and longitude of the points.
The arguments are provided by the functionality of the serverless functions.
3. We will iterate over the `points` list and calculate the distance between each pair of points.
We will sum all the distances and return the total distance in meters.
4. The function will return a dictionary with the `body`, `statusCode` and `headers` fields.
It is required to return it in this form to allow connecting via cURL.

The code for the `__main__.py` file should look like this:
```python
from geopy.distance import geodesic

def main(args):
    points = args.get("points", [])
    total_distance = 0.0
    for i in range(len(points) - 1):
        start_point = points[i]
        end_point = points[i + 1]
        distance = geodesic(start_point, end_point).meters
        total_distance += distance

    return {
      "body": {"distance": total_distance},
      "statusCode": 200,
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      }
    }
```

We also need to provide the `requirements.txt` file with the `geopy` library and file which will tell Digital Ocean how to install the dependency.

- `requirements.txt`
```
geopy
```
- `build.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

virtualenv --without-pip virtualenv
pip install -r requirements.txt --target virtualenv/lib/python3.9/site-packages
```
You may also need to add the execution permission to the `build.sh` file:
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
```

The final structure of the project should look like this:
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ packages
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ world-map-path
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ distance
â”‚Â Â          â”œâ”€â”€ __main__.py
â”‚Â Â          â”œâ”€â”€ build.sh
â”‚Â Â          â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ project.yml
```


### Deploying the function

Now we are ready to deploy the code to Digital Ocean.

```bash
doctl serverless deploy . --remote-build
```
At the end of the response from the CLI you should see:
```
...
Deployed functions ('doctl sls fn get <funcName> --url' for URL):
  - world-map-path/distance
```
Let's run the command to get the URL of the function:
```bash
doctl sls fn get world-map-path/distance --url
```
The command should print the url to the function. Copy it because we will use it in the next step.

### Testing the function
Final step is testing if the function works correctly.
We will do this by calling the function using `cURL`.
We will test distance from Berlin to Warsaw.
According to the [world-map-path](https://anras5.github.io/world-map-path/) app, it should take around 510-520 km.

![world-map-path](/images/world-map-path.png)

```bash

Open terminal and run the following command:
```bash
curl -X POST "<YOUR-URL-HERE>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"points": [[52.520008, 13.404954], [52.237049, 21.017532]]}'
```
The response should look like this:

```
{
  "distance": 519108.80957046663
}
```
The distance is in meters, so it is around 519 km. Looks like the function works correctly! ðŸŽ‰

### Cleaning up

If you want to remove the function from Digital Ocean, you can do it by running the following command:
```bash
doctl serverless undeploy world-map-path/distance
```

### Conclusion
1. We have learned how to create a simple serverless function in Python using Digital Ocean Serverless Functions.
2. We tested the function using `cURL`.
3. Digital Ocean Serverless Functions can be very useful when you want use a library that is not available in your programming language but would like to use it.
It allows you to create a simple and short program to call from another one.
